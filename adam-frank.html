     <h3>Adam Frank</h3>
     

     <div class="body-text lawyer">
      <p>Adam Frank is a criminal defense specialist who, over the last eight years, has consistently achieved exceptional results for his clients. He has won numerous not guilty verdicts for clients facing life in prison, including not guilty verdicts on charges of first degree murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and sexual assault on a child. He has successfully defended clients accused of serious felonies involving domestic violence, assaulting police officers, burglary, and drug possession, among many others, regularly averting felony convictions for his clients. He also has years of experience defending people accused of misdemeanors including DUI. Adam brings the full weight of his expertise to bear on every case, understanding how any conviction, no matter the charge, can have a devastating impact on a person’s life.</p>
      <p>Adam also focuses on cases involving civil rights violations, discrimination, and wrongful termination in the workplace. As a career battler for the underdog, he embraces the opportunity to fight for the rights of people who have been wrongfully arrested, assaulted by police officers, or fired from their job for unlawful discriminatory reasons.</p>

      <h4>Background, &nbsp; Awards,&nbsp;  &amp;  &nbsp; Recognition</h4>

      <p>Adam is a 2007 graduate of the New York University School of Law, where he was an editor of the New York University Law Review. Prior to that, he graduated from Yale University cum laude and with honors in 2002. During law school he worked at the Innocence Project, helping to free people wrongfully convicted of serious crimes. He was also a summer associate at Cochran, Neufeld & Scheck, where he fought to hold cities and police forces responsible for wrongful prosecutions and to win financial recoveries for the people they had unjustly imprisoned. After graduating law school Adam joined Colorado’s Office of the State Public Defender, leaving after seven and a half years as a Senior Deputy. Together with Faisal, he graduated from the National College of Capital Voir Dire training seminar where he learned the art of jury selection in death penalty cases.</p>

    <h4>Community Interests</h4>

    <p>Adam volunteers with LYRIC (Learn Your Rights In Colorado), teaching Denver-area high school students their constitutional rights and how to assert these rights to police officers while also staying safe. In his spare time, Adam moonlights as an excellent skier, a dedicated beer brewer, and a decidedly average basketball player.</p>
