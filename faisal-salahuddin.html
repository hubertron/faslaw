     <div class="body-text lawyer">
      <p>Recognized by Thomson Reuters as a Rising Star in Criminal Defense four years in a row (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), Faisal’s practice includes civil rights, criminal defense, employment discrimination, constitutional law, and legislative policy. In 2018, Faisal was also recognized as one of Denver’s top civil rights litigators by 5280 Magazine. Before forming Frank &amp; Salahuddin LLC, Faisal was an associate at Killmer, Lane and Newman LLP ("KLN"). </p>
 
      <p>While at KLN, Faisal worked under the guidance and tutelage of some of Denver's best-known and most accomplished attorneys, David Lane, Darold Killmer, and Mari Newman. He was interviewed numerous times by media outlets regarding the Occupy Denver protests of 2011 and related free speech issues. A passionate advocate of First Amendment rights, Faisal works as pro bono associate counsel with the ACLU of Colorado, and for the last three years has worked as co-counsel on a number of cases with the highly regarded defense attorney David Wymore.</p>

      <p>Faisal began his legal career as a deputy state public defender in El Paso County and then in Arapahoe County, handling both felony and misdemeanor cases. Since 2008, he has trained attorneys and law students across Colorado on various aspects of trial work.

      <h4>Background, &nbsp; Awards, &nbsp;&amp; &nbsp; Recognition</h4>

In 2016, he was selected for and graduated from the COBALT program (Colorado Bar Association Leadership Training), and in 2017 the Colorado Bar Association selected him to serve on its Legislative Policy Committee for the 2017 legislative session. </p>

      <p>Faisal graduated from High Point University in North Carolina in 1998 and is a 2008 graduate of the University of Colorado School of Law. In 2015, he graduated from the National College of Capital Voir Dire where he learned the art of jury selection in death penalty cases. He is a member of the Colorado Bar Association and vice-chair of its Civil Rights Section, and a member of the Denver Bar Association, Colorado Plaintiff Employment Law Association, Colorado Criminal Defense Bar, and the South Asian Bar Association.</p>
